      <h3>To Design or to Develop.... that is the Request?</h3>
      <p>
        <span>N</span>o questions here. I have always been a passionate designer and fell in love with the process of design. I just felt like I understood what most people didn't. I soon fell in love with the "Design of Web". The idea's and control were almost limitless
        to me until a friend of mine asked me a question. "What does it do? You're explaining to me what it supposed to do but it's not doing anything!"
      </p>
      <p>
        That question opened up a whole new world to me called Development. It was time to utilize both sides of the brain and shake things up. Now here I am enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and others. Just check out the resume to get a wide
        array of my skill-set!
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you get when you cross a Web Designer that has the skills, knowledge and understanding of a Web Developer? You get a professional who can comprehend the limits and dynamics of development and design. You get a professional who is interested in
        progression and a more in depth understanding of the User's experience and the User's interface with the finished product. Go ahead and check out some samples of my work.
