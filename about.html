      <h3>About James Lewis</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to creating layouts for the designing or the design of web. I do have a broad understanding of those skills. With an <strong>Associates Degree of Applied Sciences in Computer Aided Drafting and Design from ITT Technical Institute</strong>,
        I have acquired great skills understanding the basics, and that is the under estimated pencil and paper. Completing thumbnails and rough drafts are very important in designing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designing is my passion. That is the reason an <strong>Associates of Science Degree in Visual Communication from Ivy Tech Community College</strong>. At Ivy tech my primary focus was Designing and the design of web and mobile applications. I dont
        see mobile devices disapearing anytime soon. I wanted to increase my skill designing and developing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing paired with Designing ia all coming together with me currently persuing my <strong>Bachelors Degree in Media Arts and Science at Indiana University Purdue University Indiana (IUPUI)</strong>. At the School of Informatics and Computing,
        I have definately being put through various test and challenges by implementing design with programming to develop professional work. Here I am learning about Web Development and Design and Media Application Development. Both are interesting and
        sounds promising.
